## **Brain MRI Detection and Segmentation Using Deep Learning**  

### **Description**  
This project aims to detect and segment brain tumors in MRI scans using deep learning techniques, specifically the **ResUNet** architecture. The model is designed to assist medical professionals by providing accurate tumor localization and segmentation.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Deep Learning-Based Segmentation:** Utilizes ResUNet for precise tumor detection.  
- **Dataset Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model performance.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Uses categorical cross-entropy loss, IoU, and Tversky Score for performance measurement.  
- **Visualization of Results:** Displays training loss curves, segmentation masks, and model performance metrics.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)  
- **Deep Learning Models:** ResUNet  
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
